    <section id="viral">
      <h2>The Power of Viral Sounds</h2>
      <p>Many artists have gained fame after a snippet of their song went viral on TikTok. Tracks like "Old Town Road" by Lil Nas X and "abcdefu" by GAYLE found mainstream success thanks to user-generated content and trends built around them.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="independent">
      <h2>Opportunities for Independent Artists</h2>
      <p>Unlike traditional music marketing, TikTok allows independent artists to promote their music directly to fans. By participating in trends, engaging with their audience, and creating authentic content, artists can build followings without major label backing.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="challenges">
      <h2>Challenges and Considerations</h2>
      <p>While TikTok offers powerful exposure, success can be unpredictable. Artists may struggle to maintain momentum after viral success, and not all viral moments translate to long-term growth or financial stability.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>TikTok has revolutionized how music is discovered and promoted. For artists willing to embrace creativity and consistency, it provides a valuable platform to connect with listeners and grow their careers.</p>
